Since *COVID-19* pandemia strikes hard, almost every programmer is writing some blog. I can't stay behind the industry trends ðŸ˜‚.
Due to the fact that I've recently started playing a little with go lang I've decided to just use [hugo][1] with [netlify][2] and this blog came alive.
This is the place where I will document my journey with go alongside my daily struggles with java and thoughts about industry.
    
I hope you will find something useful for yourself. ðŸ˜Š
